## Challenges

There wasn't very many challenges with this particular dataset, the only part of it that was more difficult was the sheer size of the dataset, but the code remained the same. It just looked at a many more rows. 

That being said, the dataset definitely has it's limits. I think more data included in it would be able to give you a more in depth look at the election, and possible give you areas where you want to really push voter turnout, or areas where it doesn't need it and most people showed up to vote.
