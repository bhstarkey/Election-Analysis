# Election-Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of our analysis was to complete an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections following a recent congressional election. In order to do so, we calculated the numnber of votes cast, got a complete list of every candidate who received votes, calculated the total number of votes and the percent of votes each candidate received, and determined the winner of the election by popular vote.

## Resources and Challenges

### Challenges
There wasn't very many challenges with this particular dataset, the only part of it that was more difficult was the sheer size of the dataset, but the code remained the same. It just looked at a many more rows.

### Resources
-Data Source: election_results.csv
-Software: Python 10.6.1, Visual Studio Code

## Results
The analysis of the election show:
-There were 





## Summary

### Advantages of Refactoring
The advantages of refactoring code is that your code runs much more smoothly and efficiently. It pretty significantly cuts down on the run time, and allows you to have a gauge of your data much more instantaneously than when it isn't refactored.

### Disadvantages of Refactoring
There are cons though. You definitely have to know more about coding in order to refactor it. There were several issues that I ran into while refactoring, that I had to work through in order for it to run. It also takes a larger chunk of time to refactor it. Not only do you have to create the initial code, but then you nhave to go through and edit it so that it runs more efficiently.

### Conclusion
Overall though, I would say it is worth it to refactor the code, especially when you have a large dataset that you are needing to run analysis on.
