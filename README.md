# Election Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of our analysis was to complete an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections following a recent congressional election. In order to do so, we calculated the number of votes cast, got a complete list of every candidate who received votes as well as which counties participated in the election, calculated the total number of votes and the percent of votes each candidate received, how many votes and what percent came from each county, calculated the total number of votes and the percent of votes each candidate received, and determined the winner of the election by popular vote and the county that had the largest voter turnout.

## Results

* There were 369,711 total votes

* The counties who voted were:

## Future Elections

With the code being set up the way that it is, it can be used for future elections with only small changes made.

For example, if you wanted to compare the presidential election, you could change the county names and references for the 50 states instead. You could also include the political party of each candidate to extract more information about the election

If you wanted to look at an entire election, not just 1 part, you can also include which position such as judge, House of Representatives, or the Senate that each candidate is running for.

## Challenges

There wasn't very many challenges with this particular dataset, the only part of it that was more difficult was the sheer size of the dataset, but the code remained the same. It just looked at a many more rows. 

That being said, the dataset definitely has it's limits. I think more data included in it would be able to give you a more in depth look at the election, and possible give you areas where you want to really push voter turnout, or areas where it doesn't need it and most people showed up to vote. Comparing the population of the counties versus how many votes each county received would be able to give you that.
